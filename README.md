      <li>Crucial for searchability on GitHub or portfolios.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </ul>


### **🛠️ 2.   Tech Stack**
<p> ✅ What's needed:
  <ul align = "justify">
    <li>The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br></li>
  </ul>
  <ol align="Justify" Type="A">
    <li>📊 Power BI - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.</li>
    <li>📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.</li>
    <li>🧠 DAX - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.</li>
    <li>📝 Data Modeling – Relational schema designed in SQL with normalized tables, foreign key constraints, and indexes for optimized queries. Schema changes are managed via SQL migrations.
    <li>📗 Excel – used in early-stage data cleaning.</li>
